# AdventOfCode-2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a personal challenge I embarked on to sharpen my problem-solving skills and enhance my analytical thinking. This project involves tackling daily coding puzzles throughout the Advent season, each designed to test and improve logical reasoning, algorithmic thinking, and coding proficiency.

By solving these puzzles, I aimed to: strengthen my analytical thinking, and improve my problem-solving skills.  

To run an exercise the program expects to read the input from a text file placed in the same package. This input must be added manually from https://adventofcode.com/2023.
